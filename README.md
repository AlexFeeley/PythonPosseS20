# Python Posse: Spring 2020 VIX
## By Alex, Jared, Lauren, and Heng

The bulk of this semester was spent learning how to develop code in Python. The group's previous 
knowledge of Python was negligible, and the group was split on whether they had previous coding 
experience or not. 

The beginning of the semester was spent individually learning through CodeAcademy's lessons on 
Python and through small, individual projects. Throughout the semester, each member of the 
group became more comfortable with Python. Additionally, a large part of this project was 
using Git and Github in order to control the workflow of the project. This was a valuable
skill for the entire group as it allowed the project to easily transition to a virtual format
with the onslaught of the *Coronavirus*. 

As this project was completed in the midst of a pandemic, it's only fitting that our simple
project on Python data visualization shows the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases per
day in each U.S. state.

**To use the repo:** Clone the repo, run the main file, and type in which state's progression
of cases you would like to see. A bar graph will appear, showing the number of cases.
